  <h3>Freedom Is Important For Happiness</h3>
  <p>Freedom is important for our happiness because it allows us to make choices
    that make us happy and gives us the opportunity to make mistakes and learn
    from them.
    So our happiness depends on how we feel about the choices we’ve made and
    continue to make in life.
    Freedom allows people to make choices that they’re proud of. This makes them
    happier because they know that they’ve earned their happiness through their own
    free will. For some people the most important thing will be economic freedom,
    for others, free speech will matter more.
    Everyone wants to be proud of the choices they’ve made in life. It’s an
    encouraging feeling when you realize that you’re exactly where you want to be in
    life because of the choices you made for yourself along the way.</p>
